## Hi there, I'm Nikki Kracher ðŸ‘‹

I am a student at ASU Online, and am majoring in Full Stack Web Development. Once I've graduated I hope to use my degree to land a job as a software engineer. Previously I took a Python coding class; however, I much prefer HTML to python. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, reading, and watching TV with my fiancee.
